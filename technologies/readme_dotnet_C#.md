C#

About
C# is an elegant and type-safe object-oriented language that enables developers to build a variety of secure and robust applications that run on the .NET Framework.

Setup

.NET
C# runs on .net, so you will need to have .NET installed before you can use C#.
To start, download the .NET SDK 

https://download.microsoft.com/download/2/E/C/2EC018A0-A0FC-40A2-849D-AA692F68349E/dotnet-sdk-2.1.105-osx-gs-x64.pkg

In some cases, there is a need to install the dotnet-install.sh separately.
https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh

Once .NET has been installed then download the C# extension from VS Code Marketplace.

Build your site
If you'd like to get started with a simple "Hello World" program on .NET Core, follow the steps below:
	0.	Initialize a C# project:
	•	Open the command prompt (or terminal).
	•	Navigate to the folder where you'd like to create the C# project.
	•	Type dotnet new console.
	•	This creates a Program.cs file in your folder with a simple "Hello World" program already written.
	0.	When the project folder is first opened in VS Code, a notification will appear at the top of the window asking if you'd like to add the required assets to build and debug your project. Select Yes.
	0.	Run the "Hello World" program by typing dotnet run in the command prompt (or terminal) or via debug in the VS Code menu an click the green play arrow.
